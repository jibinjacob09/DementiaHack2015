*What we did:*
A phone app that will that allow young onset individuals in early stages of dementia to log and retrieve memories.    The phone app will record the voice initiated memory log made by the user and stores it into a cloud based server. When the user  requests the memory log using a key word, the app will repeat the latest stored memory containing the key word back to the user. A web portal was  created to list all the memory logs made by the user, and show the most frequenty searched key word and the most stored phrase.
